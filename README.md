# Spam_Emails_Analysis

This project involved working with a dataset of 4601 email messages and extracting 57 features related to spam classification. The dataset was divided into a training set of size 3065 and a test set of size 1536.

The skills utilized in this project included data preprocessing, visualization, and classification techniques. Different preprocessing methods were applied, such as standardizing the columns, transforming the features, and discretizing each feature.

Visualizations were created to gain insights into the data. Logistic regression models were fitted to each preprocessed version of the data, and their results were interpreted. Classification errors on both the training and test sets were reported, along with identifying statistically significant features.

To further analyze the data, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis methods were applied to the standardized and log-transformed data. Classification errors were evaluated for these methods. Support vector machine classifiers, both linear and nonlinear, were also implemented. Additionally, tree-based classifiers were utilized for classification tasks.

The project culminated in the design of a classifier with the goal of minimizing the test error rate. This involved selecting an appropriate method, possibly using a combination of techniques, and fine-tuning the parameters.

Methods used: data preprocessing, visualization, and the application of various classification techniques, including logistic regression, discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and tree-based classifiers, to effectively classify spam emails.
